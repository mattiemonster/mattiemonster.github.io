### The VDF Lib is a library for creating Vortex Data Files (.vdf).

It's written in C# and can currently only be used in .NET (supports standard) applications.

It stores data in .vdf files and those files are very small, with about 800 bytes of obligatory data.

The items can be split up into categories.
