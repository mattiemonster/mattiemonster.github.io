# Mattie's Stuff
This site is a collection of... stuff I've made for little to know reason.
## Me and my accounts

Here's some stuff about me (directly from my first post):

- My name is Matthew (or referred to Matt usually) and I live in the UK.
- I have 2 cats (at the time of writing)
- I'm an only child. How lonely I am.
- I program mostly in C#, however I know quite a few languages. I can use languages like Java and C++.
- I really enjoy making games in Unity. I'm interested in learning Unreal Engine, as well as other popular engines.
- I'm terrible about graphics programming, but I'm really interested in learning it.
- I hate C++ so much.
- I know how to make a blue triangle in intermediate OpenGL. That's pretty much it.
- I use Visual Studio to code. I've tried using MonoDevelop and Code::Blocks, but never found them very practical.
- I map for Source Engine games, mostly Half-Life 2: Episode 2.
- I put way too much unnecessary information in about me pages.

I have other accounts, but I haven't listed them here, because I'm obviously not active on them at all.
