## Collection of downloadable stuff
#### VDF
##### **YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE VDFLib.dll IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS YOUR VDF EXPLORER OR CONSOLE TEST EXE TO USE THE PROGRAM.**
##### VDF IS ALSO NO LONGER IN DEVELOPMENT, AND IS ONLY HERE FOR ARCHIVAL PURPOSES.

[VDF Lib Direct Download](https://github.com/mattiemonster/VDF/releases/download/1.2.1/VDFLib.dll)

[VDF Explorer Direct Download](https://github.com/mattiemonster/VDF/releases/download/p1.2.2/VDFExplorer.exe)

[VDF Console Test Direct Download](https://github.com/mattiemonster/VDF/releases/download/1.2/VDFConsoleTests.exe)

The VDF library can only be used with .NET (standard supported). The explorer and console test applications can only be used on Windows.

The VDF explorer is currently *very* buggy.

Chrome will warn you about the dangers of dll files when downloading the VDFLib.dll file. The file is perfectly safe; if you don't believe me, check the source code or decompile the dll file (you can as it's written in C#, just use something like dotPeek)
